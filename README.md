## Overview

**AIOS-FULLSTACK's Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. Through advanced prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop refinement, these planning agents produce comprehensive specifications that go far beyond generic AI task generation.

**2. Context-Engineered Development:** The Scrum Master agent then transforms these detailed plans into hyper-detailed development stories that contain everything the Dev agent needs - full context, implementation details, and architectural guidance embedded directly in story files.

This two-phase approach eliminates both **planning inconsistency** and **context loss** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

**📖 [See the complete workflow in the User Guide](aios-core/user-guide.md)** - Planning phase, development cycle, and all agent roles

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >=20.0.0
- npm
- GitHub CLI (required for team collaboration)

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the AIOS Workflow

**Before diving in, review these critical workflow diagrams that explain how AIOS works:**

1. **[Planning Workflow (Web UI)](aios-core/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - How to create PRD and Architecture documents
2. **[Core Development Cycle (IDE)](aios-core/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - How SM, Dev, and QA agents collaborate through story files

> ⚠️ **These diagrams explain 90% of AIOS-FULLSTACK Agentic Agile flow confusion** - Understanding the PRD+Architecture creation and the SM/Dev/QA workflow and how agents pass notes through story files is essential - and also explains why this is NOT taskmaster or just a simple task runner!

## Important: Keep Your AIOS Installation Updated

**Stay up-to-date effortlessly!** To update your existing AIOS installation:

```bash
npx github:Pedrovaleriolopez/aios-fullstack install
```

This will:

- ✅ Automatically detect your existing installation
- ✅ Update only the files that have changed
- ✅ Create `.bak` backup files for any custom modifications
- ✅ Preserve your project-specific configurations

This makes it easy to benefit from the latest improvements, bug fixes, and new agents without losing your customizations!

## Quick Start

### One Command for Everything (IDE Installation)

**Install AIOS directly from GitHub:**

```bash
# Enter your project directory
cd your-project

# Run the installer directly from GitHub
npx github:Pedrovaleriolopez/aios-fullstack install
```

This single command:

- ✅ Downloads the latest version from GitHub
- ✅ Configures your IDE automatically (Windsurf, Cursor, or Claude Code)
- ✅ Sets up all AIOS agents and workflows
- ✅ Creates the necessary configuration files

> **That's it!** No cloning, no manual setup - just one command and you're ready to go.

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ required

### Updating an Existing Installation

If you already have AIOS installed:

```bash
npx github:Pedrovaleriolopez/aios-fullstack install
# The installer will detect your existing installation and update it
```

### Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal (2 minutes)

1. **Get the bundle**: Save or clone the [full stack team file](dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) or choose another team
2. **Create AI agent**: Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. **Upload & configure**: Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. **Start Ideating and Planning**: Start chatting! Type `*help` to see available commands or pick an agent like `*analyst` to start right in on creating a brief.
5. **CRITICAL**: Talk to AIOS Orchestrator in the web at ANY TIME (#aios-orchestrator command) and ask it questions about how this all works!
6. **When to move to the IDE**: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code! See the [User guide](aios-core/user-guide.md) for more details

### Alternative: Clone and Build

For contributors or advanced users who want to modify the source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pedrovaleriolopez/aios-fullstack.git
cd aios-fullstack

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the installer
npm run install:aios
```

### Quick Team Setup

For team members joining the project:

```bash
# Install AIOS with GitHub setup
npx github:Pedrovaleriolopez/aios-fullstack setup

# This will:
# 1. Check/install GitHub CLI
# 2. Authenticate with GitHub
# 3. Run the AIOS installer
```

## 🌟 Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

AIOS's natural language framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Also expansion packs can expand the core AIOS-FULLSTACK with specific functionality that is not generic for all cases. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) and learn to create your own!
